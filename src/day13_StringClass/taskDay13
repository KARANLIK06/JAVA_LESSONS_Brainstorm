Task:
	initial:
		firstName = "Wooden";
		lastName = "Spoon";

	output:
		W.S


		1. Create a class called Reverse, write a program that will reverse a
        string.
        Your program should reverse a string only 5 characters long.
        If word is shorter, display message: "Too short!".
        If word is longer, display message: "Too long!".
        Otherwise, reverse this word and print out result into the console.
        2. Create a class called TipCalculator, write a program for a tip
        calculator.
        There will be different service quality benchmarks that will determine the
        tip given.
        There will also the ability to calculate based on the number of people in
        the party and if there is a split of the bill or not.
        Poor = 5%, Fair = 10%, Good = 15%, Great = 20%, Excellent
        = 25%
        The program should display the following information based on the
        user input:
        Split or No split (Yes or No),  Number of people entered: (number)
        (each person = & in output) Check amount: (number) Service Quality:
        (String) Total to pay: Total tip: Total per person: Tip per person:
        Ex:
        Split or No split (Yes or No)?
        Yes
        Enter the number of people
        4
        Enter the check amount:
        476
        How was the srvice quality?
        (Excellent/Great/Good/Fair/Poor)
        Excellent
        output:
        Number of people entered: 4
        Total to pay: 595.0
        Total tip: 119.0
        Total per person: 148.75
        Tip per person: 29.75
        HINT: you will need to use .equals() method
        3. Create a class calledTravel. Make a cost variable to calculate how
        much the person will owe after everything.
        Ask the user if they have a valid passport (yes or no)
        If the user enters yes:
        The base cost of the ticket
        should be set to: 1000
        Ask the user the country they to travel to
        (String, multiple word)
        Ask the user how many bags they will take
        with them (byte)
        > Each bag will add 50 to the cost
        Ask the user how many people they will travel
        with (short)
        > For each person the cost is
        reduced by 100. Up to a limit of 300.
        Ask the user to Enter the name of the people
        they will travel with in one line, separating each name with a comma
        (String, multiple word)
        Print: "Your ticket is booked to
        $countryName. We have charged extra for the $numberOfBags bags but you are
        traveling with $peopleYouTravelWith so we are giving a discount. Your
        total cost is $costAmount"
        If the user enters no:
        The base cost of the passport
        renewal is: 200
                    Ask the user when their passport
        expired(int)
                        > Each year it was
        expired adds 75 to the cost
        Ask the user which country they plan to
        travel
                    Ask the user if they will be
        traveling in the next year (String - yes or no)
                        > If yes: add 100 to
        the cost
                        > If no: subtract 50
        from the cost
        Print: "Looks like your password has
        been expired for $years, but not to worry we will get it ready for you to
        travel to $allCountries. Your total cost has come out to $costAmount."
